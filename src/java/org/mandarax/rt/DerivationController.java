 * Utility class to controll the derivation process.
 * Responsibilities:

 * <li>record the derivation tree, and return it to the application</li>
 * <li>interrupt derivations</li>
 * <li>optional: progress notification</li>
 * <li>optional: loop checking</li>
 * <li>optional: stop derivation after a certain number of steps</li>
 * </ol>
 * Used to record derivation trees, and can be used to cancel the inference process.
 * Recorded are string ids of the rules, facts etc, applications can use this strings to 
 * access artefacts in the knowledge base.
